# Project-2---Front-End
Front-end content for project 2

Great Events is a basic web app that allows it's users to create, edit, and view past events that they have put together. Users have the ability to view all events for any occasions from years past and remember it's details. This comes in handy when needing to plan something similar.

Technologies Used: General Assembly WDI Instructors, Mozilla Developer Network, W3Schools, api.jquery.com, and ruby-doc.org.


Unsolved problems came on the back end and having the ability to link up my third table. The 'locations' table was to provide further details for the user to be able to store and view all events taken place in a particular place.
